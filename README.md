# 🐍 Python Learning Topics

This repository contains notes, examples, and practice code for various **Python concepts** I’ve studied.  
Each topic includes explanations and sample programs demonstrating how the concept works.

##  Topics Covered

### 1. **Multithreading**
- Understanding the `threading` module.
- Creating and managing multiple threads.
- Synchronization using `Lock`, `RLock`, and `Semaphore`.
- Thread safety and shared data access.
- Real-world examples: downloading files, performing parallel computations.

### 2. **Multiprocessing**
- Using the `multiprocessing` module to run code in parallel processes.
- Difference between threads and processes.
- Using `Pool`, `Process`, and shared memory (`Value`, `Array`).
- Communication between processes using `Queue` and `Pipe`.
- Performance considerations and CPU-bound vs I/O-bound tasks.

### 3. **Memory Management**
- Python’s automatic memory management and garbage collection.
- Reference counting and cyclic garbage collector.
- The `gc` module for manual control.
- Memory optimization using generators and `__slots__`.
- Tools for memory profiling (e.g., `sys.getsizeof()`, `tracemalloc`).

### 4. **List Comprehension**
- Syntax and advantages of list comprehensions.
- Nested and conditional comprehensions.
- Dictionary and set comprehensions.
- Replacing loops with cleaner one-liners.
- Performance comparison with regular loops.

### 5. **Data Structures""
